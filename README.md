# Scraper: Tools for scraping information from market-places. 
These tools were made as a school project. To describe the project, rstudio was used to knit the file report.html. The file contains an introduction to webb-scraping and an example analysis where blocket was scraped. 

## Viewing the report
As the report contains an interactive map, it could not be output as a github document. Hence the files raw content has to be saved to a html file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWorkingBee/Scraper/main/Report/report.html?token=AKXNYFELMG64TJGJTRQZZRTARE4RQ) (press ctr-s and set the file-name to report.html). If that seems to inconvenient, a much less formatted/interactive pdf version has been added [here](https://github.com/TheWorkingBee/Scraper/blob/main/Report/report.pdf).
